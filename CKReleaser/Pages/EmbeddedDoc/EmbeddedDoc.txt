== Main Window

The header displays the path of the Solution folder: there must not be any .sln files in directories above
and this folder should be the working directory or be in a git repository working directory. One can change 
this root folder at any time.
The header also displays the count of solutions and projects file found and also:
- the current Git branch name, marks with a * if the working folder is dirty.
- the current Version in a button that allows the version to be set (see Versioning below).

Check points are:

- Naming:
	- The Solution folder name (the root) must be the same as the Name in Solution.ck.
	- For projects, ProjectName (name of the .csproj) is the reference name.
	- ProjectName can end with ".Net40" or ".Net45": this suffix is ignored by following rules.
	- Assembly name must be the same as ProjectName.
	- Projects that reference nunit.framework are Tests projects. 
	- A Test project name must end with ".Tests".
	- Projects that are contained in a Test project OR are inside Tests/ folder but do not reference nunit.framework are SubTests projects.
	- SubTests projects have no constraints.

- Shared information among projects.
	- The SharedKey.snk must exist at the root.
	- All projects except Tests and SubTests must be signed with this SharedKey.
	  (Tests projects are free to be signed or not.)
	- A SharedAssemblyInfo.cs must exist at the root.
	  It must contain global stuff such as Company, Copyright, etc.
	- All Projects except Tests and SubTests must have link to this file (typically in their Properties sub folder).
	- The SharedAssemblyInfo.cs contains the company name, the copyright, the product name etc.
	  In Simple Versioning mode (the only one as of today), the SharedAssemblyInfo.cs contains 
	  the Version attribute: all non-test projects will automatically use this solution level version.

- Version information
	- As of today, only "Simple Versioning Mode" is implemenented.
	- The centralized version is in the SharedAssemblyInfo.cs file.
	- The AssemblyVersionAttribute must be defined with three numbers: Major.Minor.Patch.
	- The AssemblyFileVersionAttribute is useless and must be removed.
	- The AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute "%ck-standard%" and is filled by CK.Stamp.Fody.

- Misc
	- There can not be more than one .csproj in a folder
	- Signed assemblies that reference unsigned ones are detected and a fix allows to sign them 
	  with the SharedKey: no more "Assembly generation failed -- Referenced assembly 'LibGit2Sharp' does not have a strong name."
	  Note: This is currently done only for the referenced assembly itself. Strong Naming its dependencies has to be done.
